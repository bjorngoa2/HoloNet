A static class is defined as a class that contains only static members (of course besides the instance members inherited from [System.Object](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object) and possibly a private constructor). Some languages provide built-in support for static classes. In C# 2.0 and later, when a class is declared to be static, it is sealed, abstract, and no instance members can be overridden or declared.

Static classes are a compromise between pure object-oriented design and simplicity. They are commonly used to provide shortcuts to other operations (such as [System.IO.File](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.file)), holders of extension methods, or functionality for which a full object-oriented wrapper is unwarranted (such as [System.Environment](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment)).

✔️ DO use static classes sparingly.

Static classes should be used only as supporting classes for the object-oriented core of the framework.

❌ DO NOT treat static classes as a miscellaneous bucket.

❌ DO NOT declare or override instance members in static classes.

✔️ DO declare static classes as sealed, abstract, and add a private instance constructor if your programming language does not have built-in support for static classes.
